Project Description

Mission Whisper is a conceptual AI-powered system designed to monitor astronaut stress and emotional well-being during long-duration space missions. It analyzes voice recordings, facial expressions, biometric data, and mission logs to detect signs of stress or cognitive overload. The system generates a risk score and displays results on a real-time dashboard, alerting NASA flight surgeons, mission control psychologists, and astronaut crews to potential issues. This project includes a detailed proposal, solution plan, and testing plan to ensure a robust design.
